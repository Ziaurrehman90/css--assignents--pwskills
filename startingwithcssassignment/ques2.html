    <h1>Introduction to CSS</h1>
 
    <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a fundamental technology used for designing and formatting web pages. It's a stylesheet language that allows web developers to control the presentation and layout of web documents, including HTML and XML documents. Here's some key information about CSS:</p>
 <br>
 <h3>Purpose</h3><br>
    <p> CSS is used to define the visual style of web content, such as fonts, colors, spacing, layout, and more. It separates the content (HTML) of a web page from its presentation, enhancing the flexibility and maintainability of web designs.</p>
<br> <h3>Syntax</h3> <br>
    <p>Syntax: CSS consists of rulesets, each consisting of a selector and a declaration block enclosed in curly braces. The selector specifies which elements the rule applies to, and the declaration block contains one or more property-value pairs.</p>
